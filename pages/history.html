                    <p><strong>"Elvis Project"</strong></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>In the 20th century, the most successful vocal synthesizing attempt had been "<i>Queen of the Night</i>" from Mozart's opera <i>The Magic Flute</i>; this had been made in 1984 by Yves Potard and Xavier Rodet using the CHANT synthesizer.
                </p>
                <p>Jordi Bonada, a senior researcher at the Music Technology Group at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona joined the university in 1997. Bonada worked on a research project as requested by YAMAHA which contained some "interesting" ideas. Bonada was known to have set about recording not just a song from a singer, but various ranges and pitch in an attempt to build a model that any song could be built from. The project was codenamed "Elvis" and lasted two years. It did not become a product at the end of its development. This was due to the fact this particular project was too large due to being based on spectral morphing techniques and each song required a professional singer behind it.
                </p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    <p><strong>"Daisy Project"</strong></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>While it did not become a product, the "Elvis Project" helped establish that a series of phonetics in a wide range of pitches would help build a synthesizer based on any model. YAMAHA agreed to help them start a fresh new project; it was at this point that <i>Kenmochi Hideki</i> joined. The first initial ideas came from him in Japan in 2000, with most of the research done at the <i>Pompeu Fabra University</i> and the development of the core signal processing libraries created in C++. YAMAHA itself was responsible for the product design and development of the actual product. It was pure collaborative research, and they did not think about selling at that time.
                </p>
                <p>At the time, synthesizers would take days to produce good quality results, but the vocal would always sound inhuman and obviously generated by a machine or computer. The price was expensive as well. This meant that while all other parts of the music production were by then fully able to be recreated in a DAW, producing a good quality vocal performance meant hiring a human vocalist. So, the aim of the project was to provide a fast, low cost way of getting uncanny human-like vocals to give producers full control of music production. They used "Elvis" as the base model for ideas and set about to tackle two main problems:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>how to process and transform singer recordings so that it would result in a performance of a given song sounding as natural as possible and provide the feeling of a continuous flow</li>
                    <li>how to process and transform the singer recordings so that it would result in a performance of a given song sounding as natural as possible and provide the feeling of a continuous flow</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The VOCALOID™ project was originally codenamed "Daisy Project" ("DAISYプロジェクト" or "でいじぃぷろじぇくと"), a name taken from the song "<i>Daisy Bell</i>" and was at a prototype stage in March 2002. Daisy was developed as the first voice model and it allow the researchers to transform vocal timbres in a natural manner while preserving subtle detail. At first, "Daisy" could only say vowels like "ai (love)". Four months later, "Daisy" began to support consonants, with the first "complete word" being "asa" (morning).
                </p>
                <p>Because YAMAHA itself could only provide limited vocals, they licensed the software out to various 3rd party studios. The first studio to join this project was Crypton Future Media, who were contacted in May 2002. YAMAHA then attempted to find English studios to support an English version, but the majority of responses to contact were negative. The first studio to enter development was Zero-G, joining in the fall of 2002, with PowerFX also joining that year. Thus, both English and Japanese voicebanks began development.
                </p>
                <p>At the 6th anniversary of VOCALOID™, <i>Hiroyuki Itoh</i> noted that they received demos from Zero-G without warning of what seemed to be a male vocal singing. Since they came unexpectedly, they did not realize they were VOCALOID™ demos and thought they were some sort of prank.
                </p>
                <p>"Daisy" was demonstrated at the 6th anniversary of VOCALOID™, where a file called "<i>Fly Me to the Moon</i>" was played, the file was originally created for 7/16/2002 when Crypton were shown the first demonstration in their Sapporo office. "Daisy" still had troubles with consonants at the time.
                </p>
                <p>"Daisy" dropped as a name due to conflicts with copyrighting - despite attempts to change the name (such as translating it into Japanese), they ultimately could not register it.
                </p>
                <p>The only 4 known vocals for "Daisy" were; <i>LEON</i>, <i>LOLA</i>, <i>HANAKO</i> and <i>TARO</i>. LEON and LOLA were the only ones ever to be shown to the public, releasing as official voicebanks for the final VOCALOID software.

                    <p>Kenmochi reported the name of the software was very hard at the time to decide and "VOCALOID" had fallen into 3rd place as a choice of name. The name "VOCALOID" was chosen 2 or 3 weeks before its announcement, after the 2nd choice name failed due to a copyright conflict with a software in Belgium, "VOCALOID" being a portmanteau of the words "Vocal" and "Android" ("<b>vocal</b> and<b>roid</b>"). Kenmochi choose to announce the technology on February 26, 2003, a day before his birthday.
                    </p>
                    <p>The original design of VOCALOID™ was to act as a replacement singer for a real singer. Many reviewers at the time of <i>LEON</i> and <i>LOLA</i>'s release thought that "VOCALOID" was a bold effort, as human speech was a complex thing to recreate. VOCALOID was regarded as the first of its kind to tackle singing vocals.
                    </p>
                    <p>KAITO and MEIKO were originally recorded by YAMAHA themselves, before being made for commercial release. KAITO ended up being delayed a year and a half.
                    </p>
                    <p>The first VOCALOIDs, LEON and LOLA, made their debut appearance and initial release at the <i>NAMM Show</i> on January 15, 2004. LEON and LOLA were then released in Japan by the studio Zero-G on March 3, 2004, both of which were sold as a "Virtual <i>Soul Vocalist</i>". They were also demonstrated at the Zero-G Limited booth during <i>Wired Nextfest</i> and won the 2005 Electronic Musician Editor's Choice Award. Zero-G later released MIRIAM, with her voice provided by <i>Miriam Stockley</i>, in July 2004. Later that year, <i>Crypton Future Media, Inc.</i> also handled the release of the first Japanese VOCALOID, MEIKO. It was during this time period between MIRIAM and MEIKO's respective releases that the first rival software <i>Cantor</i> was released and aimed to compete with <i>VOCALOID</i>, known only in the western hemisphere by LEON, LOLA, and MIRIAM.
                    </p>
                    <p>Later Game Audio Network Guild held the "2nd Annual G.A.N.G. Awards Show" on Thursday, March 25, 2004 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose, California, during the Game Developer's Conference 2004. The software won the "Best New Audio Technology" award in Industry &amp; Trade category.

                <p>Though LEON, LOLA, MIRIAM, and MEIKO experienced good sales, MEIKO gaining sales of 3,000 in her first year in particular, KAITO initially failed commercially and sold just 500 units. Despite this, the software was overall successful and was followed by the <i>VOCALOID2</i> engine.
                </p>
                <p>It is is notable that back in 2004, VOCALOID was released towards the end of the "FLASH golden age" (FLASH黄金時代), a period known for the rise of <i>flash-based</i> productions in Japanese websites (1998-2002/2005, end date arguable) and the birth of video sharing sites such as YouTube and Nico Nico Douga.
                </p>
                <p>At the closing of the <i>VOCALOID</i> era, it was confirmed that 3 groups had joined production of the software. These companies were: Crypton Future Media, Zero-G Ltd and PowerFX. However, PowerFX, having been introduced to the software via LE♂N and L♀LA's demonstrations at the 2002 NAMM Show, did not produce any vocals for this version for VOCALOID, making their entrance at the beginning of the VOCALOID2 era. However, it is known they had a <i>Vocal in development</i> as early as 2003 that was intended for the engine under the name of "JODIE" as well as a <i>male vocal</i> "RONIE".
